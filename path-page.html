<p>I was born and raised in Charlottesville, Virginia, and my career ambitions began with music. I began playing the saxophone at the age of 14, found I was talented at it and very much enjoyed it, 
and somehow felt it was self-evident that I should become a professional musician. In applying to college, I only considered institutions with a jazz program. 
I initially attended <a href="http://www.vcu.edu/">Virginia Commonwealth University</a>,
which had the top-rated school of the arts in the country at the time. I realized while attending VCU that I was not cut out to be a professional musician, 
as I am uncomfortable with several necessary aspects of the lifestyle.</p>

<p>While still attending VCU, I had taken an interest in the German language. This interest was initially
inspired by the German band Rammstein, whose songs are sung almost entirely in German. I found <a href="http://herzeleid.com/en/lyrics">lyrics</a> of several
of the band's songs posted online alongside English translations and found the similarities and differences between the English and the German fascinating. 
I was able to listen to several of  the band's albums, which allowed me to absorb German pronunciation rules and vocabulary terms.
Inspired by this, I took a first-semester German class during my last semester at VCU. 
Since then, I have dedicated varying degrees of time and effort to studying European languages such as Russian and Italian.
German, though, continues to be my favorite language and the only one in which I can claim to be fluent.</p>

<p>At some point during my attendance at VCU, I became acquainted with a student attending the <a href="http://www.wm.edu">College of William and Mary</a>, 
a higher-tier Virginia university which I investigated and found interesting. 
This eventually led to my being accepted at William and Mary, where I chose German as a major. I was and continue to be very impressed by the aesthetics of the written and spoken language as well as its grammatical structure, 
and also appreciated its place in Western cultural heritage. I found the subject easy to become absorbed in, and also considered that it was a practical skill
to a greater degree than music.</p>

<p>After some difficulty with health problems which extended the time it took to finish the German program, 
I graduated and moved back to Charlottesville again, but was not successful in finding paid employment.
I had a limited work history, although I had some experience volunteering in libraries years earlier at both VCU and the University of Virginia.
Now that I had graduated, I decided to volunteer in libraries again. These included three of the University of Virginia libraries, where I asked the librarians
about the prospects for working in a library in a paid capacity. I was consistently informed that I would need a master's degree
in order to do this. I knew that I was interested in language and books, that I had found it very energizing to work in this type of environment, and that I felt libraries were providing an important service to society,
which I had benefited from personally. I decided, then, to go to graduate school for a library science degree.</p>

<p>After settling on the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and beginning the master's program there, I soon concluded from the course material that I was not cut out to be a librarian. Fortunately, though, I found that I could easily switch to information science, 
another program within the same <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/programs">School of Information and Library Science</a>. 
This would give me more numerous and higher-paying job opportunities which were more in line with my personality.
From my experience of classes in this program, I have found front-end web development and programming particularly interesting, 
and I include work samples originally begun as projects for this type of courses on the curriculum vitae page here.
I have particularly enjoyed the similarities between the experience of learning languages such as Python, PHP, and Javascript and learning a natural language.
It is especially interesting to see how when dealing with computers, minor changes in language can immediately cause or solve practical problems. </p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement in my job opportunities since deciding to come to UNC Chapel Hill. Not only have the school's listservs
provided many interesting offerings, but immediately before moving to Chapel Hill, I found employment online through a stroke of <a href="http://about.amara.org/2014/08/29/august-2014-subtitler-spotlight/">luck</a>.  
For some time I worked for <a href="http://amara.org">Amara</a>, a project of a nonprofit called the Participatory Culture Foundation.
My ability with languages has come in handy here, as it is an organization dedicated to producing subtitles for videos.
These include not only same-language English subtitles but a variety of German material as well, including some translations
between German and English. I found this work rewarding and did it as an independent contractor according to my own schedule.
Most recently, I had a part-time trial position as a testing, documentation and support project manager for the same organization.
This trial position did not ultimately work out, but what work I completed involved providing suggestions to improve the site's <a href="http://support.amara.org/support/solutions/13504">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I have long been interested in politics, and done a significant amount of work for the cause of <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/~ferrerih/web-dev-project/marijuana-policy-page-b.html">drug policy</a> reform in particular.
This has included interning with the <a href="http://mpp.org">Marijuana Policy Project</a> and assisting <a href="http://www.leap.cc">Law Enforcement Against Prohibition</a> (LEAP).
Most recently, I assisted LEAP in booking their <a href="http://www.leap.cc/speaker-list/">speakers</a> for interviews as well as for presentations at conferences. 
Following the progress of changes in the laws was very interesting, and I also enjoyed writing articles analyzing the issue and arguing for reform. 
I am no longer so dedicated to the same views, however. I am also unsure about the fit between myself and many jobs in politics in terms of lifestyle.</p>

<p>I completed my final requirement for the information science program, the <a href="https://github.com/bdferr/masters-project">master's project</a>, in early August of last year. 
In my case this involved part-of-speech tagging, a natural language processing technique, as applied to a particular chronological division of a period of historical German text. 
The project was challenging yet rewarding, not least because it has given me more experience with Microsoft Excel, which I used for in-depth analysis of the results,
as well as with Python, which I used for preprocessing of the text. This was my first ever use of Linux, for which I used a virtual machine, namely a Oracle VM VirtualBox. 
I also enjoyed the connection to Western cultural heritage, and of course the historical German language in particular.</p>

<p>From September through November of last year I was a temporary web developer for <a href="https://worldstrides.com">WorldStrides</a>, an educational travel organization
which organizes trips for student groups. I mainly assisted with moving an old set of websites to a new server and writing the redirect rules necessary to direct web traffic
to the sites' new locations. The redirects involved regular expressions, an interesting sort of language which I have enjoyed studying and using. I also made limited use of Python for cross-browser testing. 
This work was interesting to me not only because of the development of redirect rules
but again because of the connection to Western cultural heritage; the organization's trips mostly take place around the Western world.</p>

<p>My continuing passion could broadly be described as language.
This includes natural languages such as German but more importantly the programming and markup languages I am focusing on more recently in connection with web development.
These include the programming languages Javascript, PHP, and SQL, the markup languages HTML and XML, and related technologies such as CSS3, XSLT and XPath.
Front-end web development in particular interests me. I have acquired several certifications through W3Schools.com and continue to study the tutorials on that website for additional technologies,
most recently the Javascript frameworks Bootstrap and AngularJS. I hope that I can continue to contribute to web development and improve my skills in this area throughout my life. </p>
