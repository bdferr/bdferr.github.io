		I was involved in drug policy reform activism for several years, as I have long found the war on drugs a fascinating topic.
		This included working as an intern for the <a href="https://mpp.org">Marijuana Policy Project</a> (MPP), working in various capacities 
		for <a href="https://www.lawenforcementactionpartnership.org">Law Enforcement Against Prohibition</a> 
		and writing articles for a similar nonprofit advocacy organization, <a href="https://ssdp.org/about/blog-contributors/brendan-ferreri-hanberry/">Students for Sensible Drug Policy.</a>
        <br />
		<br />
		The diagram above, from <abbr title="Marijuana Policy Project">MPP</abbr>, depicts the current state of state-level marijuana laws. 
		Those in black have both removed criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana and passed medical marijuana laws. 
		Those in dark gray have only removed criminal penalties for possession of small amounts, which is commonly known as decriminalization. 
		Those in light gray have passed medical marijuana measures only, while those in dark blue have legalized marijuana
		in a similar manner to alcohol, with a minimum legal age of 21. Those in light blue have legalized the possession and cultivation
		of limited amounts of the drug for adults but without a system of legal sales, and also have medical marijuana laws.
		The presence of a decriminalization or medical marijuana law in a legalized state is of course superfluous,
		but it is noted as it reflects the fact that there were earlier reforms to the law before the more recent legalization.
		The data in the table below consist of the same information conveyed by the diagram, but in a responsive table format which is implemented with jQuery. 
		<br />
		<br />
		According to recent Gallup <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2017/10/25/poll-legal-marijuana-support-at-record-high-in-u-s/#75d42ef343ff">polling</a>,
		64% of voters now support legalizing marijuana. This is an all-time high and continues a steady upward trend which began in 1996 with the passage
		of the first state-level medical marijuana laws. For the first time ever, support for legalization includes a bare majority of Republican voters.
		Quinnipiac <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2453">polling</a> 
		earlier this year indicated that 94% supported medical marijuana "if their doctor prescribes it," while 73%, including majorities of all demographic
		groups, opposed	enforcing federal laws against marijuana in states that have legalized it. A full 78 percent opposed marijuana's current classification in Schedule I,
		the most restrictive category in the Controlled Substances Act indicating that the drug has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.
		<br />
		<br />
		Currently, an estimated 67.4 million people, or about 21% of the 325 million people in the United States according to this year's <a href="http://www.census.gov/popclock/">census</a>, 
		live in the eight states where marijuana has been legalized.
		The majority of Americans live in one of the 32 states (or the District of Columbia) where some sort of marijuana law reform has been passed. Fourteen states have decriminalization
		in effect without legalization, while 29 states plus the District of Columbia (including many of the same states with decriminalization or legalization) have medical marijuana laws in effect.
		These numbers are a dramatic increase from the state of affairs as recently as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rob-kampia/marijuana-legal-states_b_3750123.html">2013</a>.
		Four of the legalization measures, along with four for medical marijuana, were just <a href="http://time.com/4559278/marijuana-election-results-2016/">passed</a> in November of 2016.
		<br />
		<br />
		Changes to federal law currently under consideration in Congress can be found <a href="https://www.mpp.org/federal/marijuana-policy-reform-in-the-115th-congress/">here</a>. 
		<br />
		<br />
		*Washington, DC passed a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_D.C._Marijuana_Legalization,_Initiative_71_(November_2014)">referendum</a> on November 4th, 2014
		legalizing the possession (up to a certain amount) and home cultivation of marijuana, which went into effect on February 26th, 2015. 
		However, all sale of marijuana outside of a medical context remains illegal.
		<br />
		<br />
		There is a similar situation in Vermont, where on January 22 of this year Governor Phil Scott signed 
		a <a href="https://www.mpp.org/states/vermont/vermont-legalization-law/">bill</a> legalizing possession 
		and cultivation of limited amounts of marijuana by adults 21 and older. The bill will take effect on July 1. 
		Non-medical sale of marijuana again remains illegal for the moment, although a study 
		<a href="http://www.vermontpressbureau.com/2017/09/07/scotts-pot-commission-seeks-recommended-legislation-for-2019/">commission</a> 
		has been meeting since 2017 on topics including the taxation and regulation of a future marijuana market.
		<br />
		<br />
		**Overwhelming majorities of both the Maine House and Senate approved a law in October of last year which would have implemented 
		a licensing and regulation scheme for marijuana in response to a 2016 referendum. 
		In November of that year, voters approved <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_Marijuana_Legalization,_Question_1_(2016)">Question 1</a>
		to legalize marijuana by a margin of less than 1%.
		<br />
		<br />
		However, on November 3rd of last year, Governor Paul LePage 
		<a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2017/11/03/politics/lepage-vetoes-bill-to-regulate-marijuana-sales-in-maine/">vetoed</a> the bill,
		citing several concerns including conflict with existing state law and uncertainty over the federal government's reaction.
		The house subsequently voted 74-62 in support of the bill, but this fell short of the two-thirds majority necessary to override the veto.
		Consequently, although marijuana is now legal for adults over the age of 21 to possess and cultivate,
		a system of legal sales of marijuana has been delayed.
		<br />
		<br />
		More recently, a new bill to a similar effect has been voted on, and although Governor LePage 
		was no more supportive of this measure, this time the legislature has overwhelmingly 
		<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/maine-lawmakers-override-governors-marijuana-veto/">voted to override Governor LePage's veto. 
		It is still not clear when marijuana sales can be expected to commence in Maine, but they are certainly delayed 
		compared to the other three states which passed similar laws in the same year. 
		Nevada and California have already begun legal sales, while Massachussetts is expected to due so in June of this year.
		<br />
		<br />
		***Whether Missouri qualifies as a state with marijuana decriminalization is debatable. 
		A bill was <a href="http://www.thedailychronic.net/2014/32351/missouri-marijuana-decriminalization-bill-becomes-law-without-governors-signature/">passed</a>
		in May of 2014 which removes the possibility of jail time for possession of up to 10 grams of marijuana. 
		However, the law only applies to first offenses, and would not actually remove the threat of criminal penalties other than incarceration.
		<br />
		<br />
		****New York passed a decriminalization measure in 1973 but there have since then been 
		<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/141866/the_epidemic_of_pot_arrests_in_new_york_city">complaints</a> of frequent arrests for minor marijuana possession,
		arguably due to exploitation of a loophole in the law.
