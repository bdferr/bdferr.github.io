//I was not sure whether keypress() or keydown() was more appropriate here.
//Keypress() ignores keys such as delete and backspace.
//This could be good in that if I am simply deleting a word, I might not want
//shorter component strings of that word to be sent as queries for suggestions.
//On the other hand if I were to enter a two-word query and then delete one word of it,
//using keypress() as I am doing means that I would then not get suggestions
//for just the first word.
