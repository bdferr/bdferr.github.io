			This page is inspired by my love 
			for the classic Sierra RPG/adventure game <cite>Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness</cite>, first released in 1993.
			Sierra was also known for other popular adventure game series such as <cite>King's Quest, Space Quest</cite> and <cite>Police Quest</cite>.
			<cite>Quest for Glory IV</cite> takes place in and around a small town called Mordavia in a fictional medieval land of the same name, 
			based on Slavic Eastern Europe judging from the characters' names and accents,
			as well as the elements of Slavic folklore such as the domovoi and rusalka incorporated into the story.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game is notable not only for its gameplay, which with the exception of the combat system is
            mostly similar to all previous games in the series,	but for its excellent <a href="#music">music</a> and its visual aesthetic. 
			Some consider the title the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/17/the-glory-of-quest-for-glory/">best</a> of the five entries in the series, 
			and while contemporary <a href="http://www.sierragamers.com/uploads/24082/Articles/Article_Quest_For_Glory_4_ReviewCompuerGameReview1994.pdf">reviews</a> 
			were not outstanding, some now call it one of the <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-25-best-adventure-games/">best</a> 
			<a href="http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18643/page17">adventure games</a> of all time.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man you might see to your left depending on your screen width is Dr. Cranium, a bizarre but helpful scientist character from the game,
			while the background image is the inside of his lab. This is a reference to the <cite>Dr. Brain</cite> series of puzzle games released by the same company.
			</p>
    		<p>
			My main purpose here is to follow up
			on an <a href="http://inls718userinterfacedesign.blogspot.com/2015/01/i-miss-days-whenpixels-were-clearly.html">idea</a> 
			which came to me in 2015 in the context of a user interface course in graduate school.
			Namely this is an attempt to imitate much of the interface of the game, including the graphics for the game's text boxes and menus, 
			but to apply it to a website rather than a game.
			Others have already implemented some of the <a href="http://www.questformoreglory.com/downloads/qfg-cursorsT.html">cursors</a> 
			from the game as extensions to an operating system.

			All five of the original games in the series can be had cheaply from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/quest_for_glory">GOG.com</a>.
			This set of the games includes a remake of the first title with far better graphics, but unfortunately those of the second game
			are still rather primitive. You can however download a greatly improved 2008 
			<a href="http://www.agdinteractive.com/games/qfg2/homepage/homepage.html">remake</a> of <cite>Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire</cite>.
			This is freely available, as is a well-received 2013 game based on the series, entitled <cite><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/283880">Heroine's Quest</a></cite>.
			There is also a laughably awful fan-made game called <cite><a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-quest-for-glory-4-12/">Quest for Glory 4 1/2</a></cite>, released in 2012,
			while a higher-quality 2014 game partly inspired by but not explicitly based on the series is called <cite><a href="http://www.infamous-quests.com/home/games/quest-for-infamy/">Quest for Infamy</a></cite>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Many more downloads including screenshots can be found at a fan page called <a href="http://www.questformoreglory.com/index3.html">Quest for More Glory</a>,
			while help for various problems, including the game's rather creative manuals, is available at <a href="http://www.sierrahelp.com/Games/QuestForGlory/QfG4Help.html">Sierrahelp.com</a>.
			Sierragamers.com supplies the <a href="http://www.sierragamers.com/uploads/24082/Hint_Book/Quest_for_Glory_4_Hint_Book.pdf">hint book</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
			A promising "role-playing adventure game" entitled <cite><a href="http://hero-u.com/about/">Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption</a></cite> 
			is currently under development by Sierra designers Corey and Lori Cole,
			who were responsible for the <cite>Quest for Glory</cite> series and contributed to various other Sierra games such as <cite>King's Quest V</cite>.
			The title is scheduled for release somewhere between late June and mid-July.
			An ongoing fan-made effort at a <cite><abbr title="Quest for Glory">QfG</abbr></cite>-inspired game, this one
			entitled <cite>Hero6</cite>, can be found <a href="http://www.hero6.org/">here</a>.

			<h3>Icons</h3>
			<p>Here are some icons from the game, plus a bullet image used in some of the menus in the game.
			The icons are used to interact with the environment in different ways; for example, the mouth icon is used to speak with someone, 
			while the feet icon	you can see in this page's navigation menu is used to walk somewhere.
			An attempt has already been made by others to <a href="http://www.questformoreglory.com/downloads/qfg-cursorsT.html">implement</a> 
			some of these as extensions to an operating system.

			<p>
			The music for this game has been described as "gothic, folk and rock" and includes a rendition
			of <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcEnSITNaGM">Anitra's Dance</a></cite>, 
			part of <cite>Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, Op. 46</cite> by Edvard Grieg. 
			Grieg was a Norwegian nationalist composer of the Romantic era, and appropriately
			for the rural setting and peasant characters of the game, was influenced by the folk music of his own country.
			</p>
		    <p>
			According to the soundtrack's composer, <a href="http://www.aubreyhodges.com/">Aubrey Hodges</a>, 
			none of it is yet available in sheet music form. 
			The original soundtrack is however freely available on YouTube, as you can see in the video above, 
			or from <a href="http://www.sierramusiccentral.com/index.php?page=24">Sierra Music Central</a>, 
			while an updated version including live instruments and 42 new arrangements
			can be purchased from the composer's Bandcamp 
			<a href="https://aubreyhodges.bandcamp.com/album/quest-for-glory-shadows-of-darkness-official-soundtrack">page</a>.
