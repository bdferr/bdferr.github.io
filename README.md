These are samples of my web development work. These include a personal page I first began as a project for a web development course 
in graduate school in 2014, which employs mobile-first responsive design with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. 

There is also a page inspired by an old video game, Quest for Glory IV, and this is implemented with the Bootstrap framework. This page was inspired by an idea I developed in a grad school course on user interfaces, namely that I could adapt the interface of the game to a website.

The images for both of these projects were created with GIMP, Adobe Photoshop and PowerPoint.
